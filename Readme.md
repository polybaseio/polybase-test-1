# Welcome! 🙌

We're thrilled to bring to you this coding challenge where you can choose to implement either a single-page app (SPA) with a backend (like React with FastAPI) or a full server-side rendering (SSR) application without a SPA (like Django with templates).

This challenge primarily aims to evaluate:
- Your Python 👨‍💻 or/and JavaScript programming style.
- Your capability to design 🎨, structure 🏗️, and manage 🎯 an end-to-end project.

Remember, we always appreciate feedback and queries about the challenge.

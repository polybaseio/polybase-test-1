# Introduction

We are excited to present you with this coding challenge that requires you to implement either an SPA with a backend (React with FastAPI, etc.), or full server side rendering (SSR) without a SPA component (Django with templates, etc.). The aim of this exercise is to evaluate your Python or/and JavaScript programming style and your capacity to design, structure, and manage an all-inclusive project.

Donâ€™t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or feedback about this challenge.

## The Task: Construct an AI-Driven Recipe Generator Application

### Brief

The objective is to create an AI-powered platform that generates, displays, and allows users to share recipes. The architecture of the platform should be client-server, with a simple database for storing the generated recipe data.

### Specifications

- Enable users to generate, view, edit, and delete their own recipes.
- Recipes comprise a title, description, ingredients, and instructions.
- The recipe generation process should include a screen where users input a list of ingredients with their quantities and press a button to assemble the recipe.
- The AI can auto-create all parts of the recipes except for the ingredients, which must be voluntary user input.
- Feel free to use any cloud hosted language model, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.
- The frontend should be user-friendly and responsive.

### Extra Credits

- Implementing Tailwind for styling.
- Using functional React & JavaScript.
- Allowing users to save recipes to their favorites.
- Including a Dockerfile.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Incorporation of interesting prompts.

### Directions

- Feel free to choose the entire tech stack. However, ensure at the least, you integrate a database and a backend server.
- If you need support with prompts, don't hesitate to seek help!
- You are welcome to use supabase, firebase, or any similar low-code backend solutions.
- Graphical design is secondary, but do demonstrate your ability with CSS/Tailwind.
- We would like you to use GitHub for hosting the code. Please create a new repository and add 'gokaykucuk' as a user.
- Whether or not you complete all the requirements, leave the project in a functioning state.

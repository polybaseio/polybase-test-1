# Welcome

Here's a code challenge that can be implemented with either a SPA + Backend(React + FastAPI etc) OR a fully SSR without an SPA component(Django with templates etc).

The main target of the challenge is to measure,
- Programming style in Python or Javascript or both.
- Your ability to structure and manage a project end to end.

Feel free to ask questions and give feedback about this challenge at any point.

## Challenge: Build a Recipe Generator Platform

### Overview

You are tasked with building an AI based recipe generating platform where users can create, view, and generate and share recipes with others. The platform should have a client and server architecture, with a simple database to store generated recipe data. The frontend should be built using Tailwind CSS.

### Requirements

- Users should be able to generate, view, edit, and delete their own recipes.
- Recipes should have a title, description, ingredients, and instructions.
- Generation of a recpie consists of a screen where users enter a list of ingredients with their amounts and a button to generate a recipe.
- All fields of Recipes can be generated except ingredients. Ingredients are user input.
- Feel free to use any hosted LLM(like ChatGPT from OpenAI etc).
- The frontend should be responsive and easy to use.

### Bonus Points

- Tailwind.
- Functional React & Javascript
- Users are able to save recipes to their favorites.
- Dockerfile.
- IaC.
- Cool prompts.

### Guidelines

- Feel free to pick entire stack. Make sure in bare minimum you use a database and a server.
- If prompting is not your strong suite, just ask for help!
- You can use supabase, firebase and similar solutions for a low-code backend.
- Design is not that important, but show that you can use css/tailwindcss.
- Use github for code hosting, create a new repository and add `gokaykucuk` user to it.
- Try to leave the project in a working state even if you haven't done all the requirements.
